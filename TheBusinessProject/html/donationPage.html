                    &nbsp; One of the greatest concerns of our company is the overuse and waste of plastics in the world.
                    Most concerning of all is the mass dumping of perfectly good lego's.
                    Unwanted lego's should be cleaned and repaired or used to create new lego's in a sustainable way for all. <br>
                    &nbsp; So we introduce you the 'No Brick Left Behind' initiative, which takes lego's sent in and repairs them for new use.
                    To then donate them to hundreds of community centers all across the country. <br>
                    To apply, Fill out the donation form, print it out, and attach it to your box of wrapped lego's!

                    &nbsp; Water is arguably the most import resource we could ever have. It makes up just over 70% of our surface. 
                    So why is it that 1 in 4 people don't have a clean source to drink from? <br>
                    &nbsp; BrickZ works with many small foundations in the United States and
                    partnered with the Water Project to help bring clean water to all those in need. <br>
                    &nbsp; BrickZ puts over 200,000$ annually towards building wells for all in and out of the States.

                    and he knew that half of the job in any advanced school was finding good scholarship opportunities to pay for schooling. <br>
                    &nbsp; Which is why we work with over fifteen technical colleges across the state of Wisconsin to help those who need to pay for their education. 
                    Any students involved with working within out company will also have pay benefits towards their education payments.
